#
# One copy, because the alternative is what this file replaced: the same
# health_url in three scripts, each drifting on its own. Nothing here assumes a
# particular application — the database, cache and prep blocks are inert until
# the project configures them in config/test-config.env.
#
# Provides:
#   health_url                    the first health endpoint that answers 200
#   db_configured                 true when DB_NAME is set and psql exists
#   run_psql                      one query against a chosen database
#   release_idle_db_connections   terminate idle backends left by a suite
#   recover_db_pool               the same, but only over a threshold, then settle
#   flush_rate_limiter            flush the cache/rate limiter the project names
#   reset_test_environment        REDIS_FLUSH + TEST_PREP_SQL, both optional
#   clean_risk_state              the same, under the name a risk-scoring
#                                 project reaches for — one alias, not a second
#                                 implementation
#   prepare_test_environment      health check, reset, pool check — before a run
#
# Every library in harness/lib sources this file rather than keeping a copy of
# any of it. The pair that made that a rule: verbose-test-framework.sh once had
# its own reset_test_environment which called redis-cli directly and never read
# CACHE_FLUSH_CMD, so a project whose limiter is not Redis had a known-state
# step that silently did nothing.
