# Java Testing

> This file extends [common/testing.md](../common/testing.md) with Java-specific content.

Worked examples: skill `java-testing`.

## Test Framework

- **JUnit 5** (`@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@Nested`, `@DisplayName`)
- **AssertJ** for fluent assertions (`assertThat(result).isEqualTo(expected)`)
- **Mockito** for mocking dependencies
- **Testcontainers** for integration tests requiring databases or services

## Test Organization

```
src/test/java/com/example/app/
  service/           # Unit tests for service layer
  controller/        # Web layer / API tests
  repository/        # Data access tests
  integration/       # Cross-layer integration tests
```

Mirror the `src/main/java` package structure in `src/test/java`.

## Unit Test Pattern

## Parameterized Tests

## Integration Tests

Use Testcontainers for real database integration.

For Spring Boot integration tests, see skill: `springboot-tdd`.
For Quarkus integration tests, see skill: `quarkus-tdd`.

## Test Naming

Use descriptive names with `@DisplayName`:
- `methodName_scenario_expectedBehavior()` for method names
- `@DisplayName("human-readable description")` for reports

## Coverage

- Verification evidence is behavioral: the running system was exercised and state was checked. See common/testing.md.
- Use JaCoCo for coverage reporting
- Focus on service and domain logic — skip trivial getters/config classes
