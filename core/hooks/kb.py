kb — knowledge-base freshness, bound to source.

A repository analysis produces documents that are true on the day they are
written and quietly stop being true afterwards. Nothing in the documents
themselves records that: a Feature Profile describing a login flow reads
exactly the same whether the flow still works that way or was rewritten last
month. This tool removes the guess. Every claim in a profile already carries a
`<!-- SOURCE: path:L12 -->` comment naming the file and line that proves it
(the convention doc-claims-check.py enforces on write); `bind` records the
content hash of every cited file, and `status` re-hashes them and reports which
profiles still rest on the source they were written from.

The knowledge base is a directory (default Workspace/Docs/KnowledgeBase)
holding the analysis document, `profiles/` with one Feature Profile per
feature, a status matrix, and `source-index.tsv` — the machine-readable
binding this tool writes and reads.

  kb.py scaffold --root <dir> --kb <dir> [--level lite|standard|full]
                 [--pipeline-dir <rel>] [--grow] [--force]
                                                  build the knowledge base from
                                                  the tree, then bind it
  kb.py bind   --root <dir> --kb <dir>            record a hash per cited file
  kb.py status --root <dir> --kb <dir> [--level …] [--json]
                                                  current / stale / broken, what
                                                  falls short of the level, and
                                                  which source nothing describes
  kb.py impact --root <dir> --kb <dir> --files …  which profiles describe this change

The scaffold exists because the alternative was a step designed to fail: the
intake check asked for a knowledge base that only an agent run could produce, and
nothing started that run. `scaffold` reads the tree — feature units, entry points,
routes, models, the manifest — and writes a survey, one profile per feature with
its structure filled in and its narrative sections left as the prompts they are,
a status matrix, and the binding. No agent, no network, same bytes from the same
tree. What it cannot write is the part worth reading, and it says so in every
document it leaves behind.

Levels are to this step what sizes are to a work order.

  lite      a profile exists per feature, structure filled in from the tree.
            The scaffold produces this on its own, so the step passes on a
            fresh install.
  standard  the narrative sections are written: no more than half the writing
            prompts the scaffold wrote are still standing.
  full      standard, and a second reader has checked the profile against the
            source — frontmatter `validated: true` with a name in `reviewed-by`.

`scaffold` records the chosen level in `<kb>/level`; `status --level` overrides it.

Exit codes — status: 0 every profile current and at the level, 1 something is
stale, 2 something is broken (broken outranks stale), 3 there is no knowledge
base to report on, 4 everything is current but something falls short of the
level. 4 is reported only when nothing is stale or broken; the count of profiles
short of the level is on the summary line either way. impact: 0 nothing
affected, 1 at least one profile describes the change. bind: 0, or 1 when the
directory holds no profiles. scaffold: 0, or 1 when it cannot write.

`wo close` and `acp check` call `impact` to say "this change touched files these
profiles describe". Re-writing the profile is agent work and always was; this
tool only knows, and says, when it is due. `scaffold --grow` is the close-time
form: it adds profiles for features that have none and marks vanished ones
orphaned, and it re-binds nothing, so a profile describing code that just changed
stays stale until someone updates it.

The rules it shares with the hooks — the SOURCE comment's spelling, the source
extensions, the directories no rule reads, the hash — are imported from them,
so the engine and the hooks cannot drift apart.
